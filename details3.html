            <p class="margin">Artificial intelligence is making rapid strides across industries. There is no aspect of human life that has been left untouched by the explosion of AI technologies in the last few years. As developments in AI gained momentum, leaders in technology have been scrambling to offer the best of AI in their products and services. Amid the ongoing AI arms race, Google has come out with a white paper enumerating its policy agenda for AI progress.

            <p>The company, while acknowledging that it is at the cusp of a new era, asserted its commitment to moving forward boldly, responsibly, and in partnership with others. The Alphabet Inc -owned company stated that calls for a moratorium come with the risk of missing out on the ‘substantial’ benefits of AI and falling behind those who embrace its potential. Instead, the company is focusing on broad-based efforts across governments, companies, universities, etc., to translate the AI breakthroughs into benefits that are ubiquitous at the same time mitigating risks. With the white paper with policy recommendations for AI, Google intends to encourage governments to focus on unlocking opportunity, promoting responsibility, and enhancing security.

            <!-- <p>Microsoft, the first major tech company to release a paper making such a bold claim, stirred one of the tech world's testiest debates: Is the industry building something akin to human intelligence? Or are some of the industry's brightest minds letting their imaginations get the best of them?
 </p>

            
            <p>Microsoft's research paper, provocatively called "Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence," goes to the heart of what technologists have been working toward - and fearing - for decades. If they build a machine that works like the human brain or even better, it could change the world. But it could also be dangerous.
