           <p> 2022 was a banner year for artificial intelligence, with the industry seeing record adoption, funding and innovation. </p>
          <div class="o-list">
         <h5><b>AI Trends to Expect in 2023<b></h5>
            <ol>
              <li>Rapid democratization of AI tech and research</li>
              <li>Generative AI taking it up a notch</li>
              <li>Heightened AI industry regulation</li>
              <li>More emphasis on explainable AI</li>
              <li>Increased collaboration between humans and AI</li>
            </ol>
          
           </div>
           
            <p class="margin">According to a recent report published by consulting giant McKinsey & Company, which surveyed some 1,492 participants globally across a range of industries, business adoption of AI has more than doubled over the last five years. Areas like computer vision, natural language generation and robotic process automation were particularly popular. </p>

                <p>Funding in this space has also reached new heights, despite ongoing economic uncertainty. Like many other tech sectors, artificial intelligence saw a sizable drop in VC investments in the first half of 2022, hitting its lowest levels since 2020, according to a State of AI report published by private equity firm CB Insights.</p>
                
                <p>Then came the November public release of OpenAI’s AI art generator DALL-E 2, quickly followed by chatbot ChatGPT (another OpenAI creation). These groundbreaking projects triggered what can only be described as a generative AI craze, with techies and non-techies alike clamoring to make their own creations. They also prompted a massive resurgence in funding, with young AI startups pulling in nine-figure rounds and hitting billion-dollar valuations in short order. <p>
                
                <p>In the wake of 2022, artificial intelligence has evolved into one of the fastest growing industries right now, and it is continuing to move at breakneck speeds.<p>
            </p>
    
            <div class="quote">
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    “Last year was an incredible year for the AI industry,” Ryan Johnston, the vice president of marketing at generative AI startup Writer, told Built In. “This is all moving so fast that we don’t know what six months from now is going to look like, we don’t know what a year from now is going to look like.”
                  </p>

                AI Trends to Expect in 2023</h3>
            <p class="margin">That may be true, but we’re going to give it a try. Built In asked several AI industry experts for what they expect to happen in 2023, here’s what they had to say.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h5 class="paragraph-title " style="margin-top: 40px; "><b>RAPID DEMOCRATIZATION OF AI TECH AND INNOVATION<b></h5>
            </p>

            <p>Until very recently, artificial intelligence was all but dominated by juggernauts like Google, IBM, Microsoft and Amazon. The creation of this technology was much too costly and complex for smaller companies or individuals to participate in. But an open-source revolution has swept across the entire tech industry over the several years, ushering in a democratization of the artificial intelligence space, specifically. And it is poised to knock the AI crown off of Big Tech’s head.</p>
            
            <p>“The open sourcing of generative modeling is going to have a transformative impact,” Ali Chaudhry, the founder and CEO of software development company Infinit8AI, told Built In, particularly for the work of AI engineers, data scientists and others working in this artificial intelligence. “It gives them the power to kind of play around with it, tweak it and apply it in different sectors.”</p>
            
            <div class="quote" style="margin-bottom: 30px;" >“The open sourcing of generative modeling is going to have a transformative impact.”</div>
            
            <p>This has already started to happen. Last year, Hugging Face released the first community-built, multilingual large language model called BLOOM. And Stable Diffusion, Lensa and a slurry of other open-source AI art generators have brought about an explosion of individual innovation, rivaling OpenAI’s DALL-E.</p>

           
           
            <h5 class="paragraph-title " style="margin-top: 40px; "><b>GENERATIVE AI TAKING IT UP A NOTCH<b></h5>
            </p>

            <p>Generative AI is among the hottest areas of artificial intelligence, with OpenAI’s ChatGPT being the latest standout. The chatbot comprises a family of AI-powered large language models and is a slicker, more refined version of the company’s GPT-3 platform, which took the world by storm in 2020 with its groundbreaking ability to perform tasks it hadn’t explicitly learned. </p>
            
            <p>Now, ChatGPT’s ability to generate natural (if, at times, weird) language, has pushed the limits of what was previously thought possible with artificial intelligence. According to Writer’s Johnston, the release of ChatGPT alone advanced the industry by about 12 or 18 months. And it has been joined with a bevy of other generative AI models, including viral AI art generators like DALL-E 2 and Mijourney.</p>
            
            <p>Looking ahead, 2023 will be a year where industry adoption of this technology really takes off. “Businesses are going to start looking a lot more closely at generative AI and how it can impact their business,” Johnston continued. “It’s becoming much more about how can we integrate this technology into our product? How can we leverage it as part of our go-to-market efforts? How will this affect our customers? Businesses need to sort through the hype to actually figure out what’s real for them.”</p>

            <div class="quote" style="margin-bottom: 30px;" >“Businesses are going to start looking a lot more closely at generative AI and how it can impact their business.”</div>
            


            
            <h5 class="paragraph-title " style="margin-top: 40px; "><b>HEIGHTENED AI INDUSTRY REGULATION<b></h5>
            </p>

            <p>For years, the artificial intelligence industry has been a veritable Wild West, with little to no government regulation or legislation specifically managing its development and use. But that’s beginning to change. Lawmakers and regulators spent 2022 sharpening their claws, and now they’re ready to pounce.</p>
            
            <p>Governments around the world have been establishing frameworks for further AI oversight. In the United States, President Joe Biden and his administration unveiled an artificial intelligence “bill of rights,” which includes guidelines for how to protect people’s personal data and limit surveillance, among other things. And the Federal Trade Commission has been closely monitoring how companies collect data and use AI algorithms — and have taken action against some already. </p>
            
           
           
             <p>Regulation is growing on the state and local level, too. More than a dozen U.S. cities, including San Francisco and Boston, have banned government use of facial recognition software. Massachusetts nearly became the first state to do so in December, but then-Governor Charlie Baker struck the bill down. Meanwhile, in 2020, Illinois and Maryland passed laws restricting the use of face analysis technology in hiring; and in 2021, the New York City Council announced it was cracking down on the use of AI in hiring. ”</p>
